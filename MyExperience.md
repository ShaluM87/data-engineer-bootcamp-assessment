#My experience and further notes

Put here general information about the steps you took, what you liked, disliked, why did you do X instead of Y and so on.

## HDP Sandbox

I started downloading HDP Sandbox first using virtual machine. I read prerequisite for the same. I need minimum 10GB of RAM dedicated to virtual machine. But my computer RAM is just 4GB. Which was not enough.
So then i used microsoft Azure on cloud due to its flexibility and cost benefits
